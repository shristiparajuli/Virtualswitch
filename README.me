# gRPC Virtual Switch and Worker System (C++)

This project demonstrates a distributed system where a **switch server** receives gradient vectors from **worker clients** using **gRPC in C++**.

---

## What It Does

- **Worker** simulates sending gradients (floats) to the switch.
- **Switch** receives and logs these gradients.
- **Server** responds with an acknowledgment.

---

## Requirements

- **gRPC** and **Protobuf** (built with CMake and installed)
- **Abseil** (installed with CMake)
- **OpenSSL** (system-installed)
- **CMake** 3.10+ or higher
